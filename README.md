Simple Keylogger using Python

This Python keylogger captures and records keystrokes in real time. It logs each key press with a timestamp and saves the data in a file (keystrokes.log). The program runs continuously until the Esc key is pressed, displaying the recorded keystrokes upon termination. It is useful for monitoring keyboard activity but should only be used for ethical and legal purposes.
